# **Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices**

#### **Project Overview**

In this project, I will apply basic machine learning concepts on Boston Housing Dataset to predict the selling price of a new home. I will first explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I will properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. I will then analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This will enable me to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, I will test this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to my statistics.

#### **Description**

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and I want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with my peers, I decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, I've come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. My task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for my clients' homes.

#### **Software and Libraries**

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

*   NumPy
*   Pandas
*   matplotlib
*   scikit-learn
*   seaborn
*   scipy

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

#### **Starting the Project**

The boston_dataset is loaded from sklearn. The original dataset is the dictionary, so I abstract the data of features and the data of target variable from boston_dataset and form a new dataset named "boston".

In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command jupyter notebook Predict_Boston_House_Prices.ipynb to open up a browser window or tab to work with your notebook. Alternatively, you can use the command jupyter notebook or ipython notebook and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens. Follow the instructions in the notebook and answer each question presented to successfully complete the project. A README file has also been provided with the project files which may contain additional necessary information or instruction for the project.

#### **Submitting the Project**

The Predict_Boston_House_Prices.ipynb notebook file with all questions answered and all code cells executed and displaying output, which can be submitted.
